odocrypt modification
---------------------

adds an expansion chamber with expand/compress round to use a bit of memory, discouraging ASIC production.

feel free to change CHAMBER_SIZE, ensuring it is a multiple of 32.


implementation is as it is in digibyte; except for testfunc.cpp which defines the parameters for calling the hash.
